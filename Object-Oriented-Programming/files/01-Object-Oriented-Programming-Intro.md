#### What is Programming.
* `Programming is a process where programmers instruct computer through a program, how to do a task.`

#### What is Program.
* `Program is a set instructions which tells computer what to do to solve a specific problem.`

#### What is Programming Paradigms.
* `There are many ways to write a program referred as Programming Paradigms. Like Procedural, Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming etc.`

#### What is Procedural Programming.
* `Procedural Programming is derived from Structure Programming and also known as top-down programming langauge.`
* `Procedural Programming uses procedure to tell the computer what to do step by step.`
* `Procedures are list of instructions also known as routines and subroutines.`
* `Examples of Procedural Programming languages are C, Fortran, COBOL.`

#### What is Object Oriented Programming.
* `Object Oriented Programs are made of Objects.`
* `Every Object is a component of Program and knows how to performs certain tasks and interact with other component of program. So computations are carried out by objects.`
* `A key aspect of object-oriented programming is Class.`

#### What is Class.
* `Class is a blueprint of object. You can think of Class as an idea and Object is an implementation of that idea.`
* `Classes can have fields and methods. Fields(state) are responsible for holding data and methods(behavior) are responsible modifying those data.`

#### What is Object.
* `Objects are implementation of Classes. Each object has 3 characteristics Behavior, State and Identity.`
* `Object's Behavior represents how an object will react if methods on that object is called or what will happen when call methods on objects.`
* `Object's state is how an object look like at any point of time or value of fields. You change the state of object by calling methods on it. You are able to change the state of object without calling methods then your object doesn't follows encapsulation.`
* `Object's identity means every object is different even if they belong to same class and in same state.`
* `Object's state influences each other like state of an object can influence its behavior eg. if order is shipped or paid then it may reject method call that asks it to add or remove items. Conversely, if order is empty then should not allow itself to be shipped.`

#### Steps you should take to design object oriented system.
* `Identifying Classes : Identity your classes and then add methods to each class. Identifying classes meeans look for nouns in the problem analysis. Methods correspond to verbs.`
* `Find relationships between classes : The most common relationships between classes are : Dependence, Aggregation and Inheritance.`
